## Pokemon Style Game
#### Introduction
This project was my method of learning how to use Python in a more applied use case with Pygame and Tiled. Having the dream of creating a game like Pokemon Diamond when I was growing up, a 2D pokemon style game just made sense to me.

I created the game map with Tiled using the assets retrieved from: https://cypor.itch.io/12x12-rpg-tileset

#### How to play
1. Download all folders and use same folder organization. Run game.py.  
2. Walk into dark green grass or water to spawn battle sequence (sometimes this takes a little while).  
3. Use arrow keys to navigate battle options and use space bar to select.  
4. Have fun!

#### What I learned
- Fundamentals of game development (and how tricky it can be)
- Pygame library
- How to use Tiled level editor
